# Fluent Plugins Nursery

Welcome to [Fluent Plugins Nursery](https://github.com/fluent-plugins-nursery).
This is a community organization with the goal to maintain and improve Fluentd plugins.

> Our _raison d'Ãªtre_ is to keep Fluentd ecosystem healthy by adapting orphaned/stalled Fluentd plugins.

This organization is administrated by [Fluentd core maintainers](https://github.com/fluent/fluentd/blob/master/MAINTAINERS.md).

## What happens if I transfer my plugin?

**Once you transferred your plugin:**

* Your plugin gets additional support by Fluentd maintainers.
* Your plugin will be hosted under this organization e.g. `fluent-plugins-nursery/fluent-plugin-xyz`.

**We respect your authorship:**

* You retain the privilege to push to the Git repository and publish new Gems.
* You retain the full copyright on your work/contribution.
